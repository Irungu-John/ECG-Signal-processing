*Electrocardiogram  Signal Processing for COVID -19 Prediction*

Scope
________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This project is a binary classification study for prediction of COVID-19 presence in a sample of Cohorts of Positive and Negative Electrocardiograms(ECGs).The models in this research detect COVID-19 using SVM,KNN and Random Forests machine learning algorithims.

3 domains namely; Time,Frequency and Time-Frequency of the electrocardiograms are used to investigate the ECG morphological features in this study

Work Done:

1. ECG Data Preprocessing for 2 Cohorts (Positive and Negative) tested for COVID
2. ECG Feature Extraction for Time ,Frequency and Statistical domain using Time Series Feature Extractor Library(TSFEL)
3. Feature Selection and Normalization
4. Binary Classification of COVID-19 and Normal(negative)
5. Performance Evaluation of the model
